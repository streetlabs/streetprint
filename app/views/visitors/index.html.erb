<h2>PREVIOUS STREETPRINT SITES</h2>
<p>
  We are working hard to upgrade all of the existing Streetprint websites so that they will be hosted here using the new Streetprint&nbsp;5 technology. This is a work in progress but should be completed soon. Until we have completed the upgrade process you may access the old <a href="http://www.crcstudio.org/streetprintorg">Streetprint website</a> along with <a href="http://www.crcstudio.org/streetprintorg/sites.php">to-be-updated&nbsp;sites</a> at the <a href="http://www.crcstudio.org">CRC&nbsp;Studio</a>.
</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="http://www.crcstudio.org/streetprintorg/engine.php">Streetprint&nbsp;Engine</a> is still available should you require it. Please note that no further development on the engine is planned at this time.</p>
