     And I am on the site page for "mock site"
     And I log out

  Scenario: Next previous item links show up and work appropriately
    Given I log in as "owner@example.com"
    When I go to the item page for "item_1" in "Mock site"
    Then there should be a next item link
      And there should not be a previous item link
    
    When I follow "Next Item"
    Then I should be on the item page for "item_2" in "mock site"
      And there should be a next item link
      And there should be a previous item link
      
    When I follow "Previous Item"
    Then I should be on the item page for "item_1" in "mock site"
    
  
  Scenario: Next previous item links maintain context of search
    When I go to the items page for "mock site"
      And I fill in "search" with "cat_b"
      And I press "search"
      And I follow "item_1"
    Then there should be a next item link
      And there should not be a previous item link
    
    When I follow "Next Item"
    Then I should be on the item page for "item_2" in "mock site"
    
    When I follow "Next Item"
    Then I should be on the item page for "item_3" in "mock site"
      And there should not be a next item link
