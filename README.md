Streetprint 5.0
===============

Visit the Streetprint [website][website] at http://www.streetprint.org to find out more about the Streetprint Engine.

A Project of the [CRCStudio][studio]

Setup
-----

First clone the project.

    git clone git://github.com/crcstudio/streetprint.git

Now install all the required gems:

    sudo rake gems:install

Customize config/database.yml to your liking and then run these two tasks to setup the database:

    rake db:create
    rake db:schema:load
    rake db:seed

Mail server settings will need to be set in config/email.yml.

Make sure you have [Sphinx][sphinx] installed and then set the appropriate path to searchd in config/sphinx.yml (`rake ts:config` should do this for you).  You can now start sphinx.

    rake ts:index
    rake ts:start

You will also need to have [ImageMagick][imagemagick] and [rmagick][rmagick] installed. For anyone on OS X there is a ruby script that removes the pain of the [rmagick installation][rmagick-osx].  

You can run the tests to make sure that everything is working however this will require installing all the testing dependencies including [Selenium][selenium]. Note that Selenium currently requires the installation of *[Firefox 3.0.11][ff3011]* and that __newer versions of Firefox will not work__.

    sudo gem install Selenium

    sudo rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test
    rake test:all
